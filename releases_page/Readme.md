# Opentofu Releases Page

This Go program interacts with the GitHub API to retrieve release information about Opentofu. It is designed to generate HTML files, facilitating a user-friendly interface for navigating through the releases and downloading associated assets.

The site is statically generated, ensuring that all HTML pages are created during the build stage. These pages are then subsequently deployed, enabling seamless access to release artifacts.
